Row marker prompt
Create a modular JavaScript + HTML + CSS component called "shaping rows."

Purpose:
To display row numbers for any shaping instruction (increases, decreases, or short rows) beneath the main text instructions in smaller, subdued text.

Requirements:

1. Structure:
   - The block receives three numeric inputs:
       • startRow (integer, default = 1)
       • repeatEvery (integer, number of rows between shaping actions)
       • totalRepeats (integer, total number of shaping actions)
   - Example input:
       { startRow: 1, repeatEvery: 4, totalRepeats: 4 }

2. Output logic:
   - Calculate the specific row numbers where shaping occurs.
   - Example:
       Input → { startRow:1, repeatEvery:4, totalRepeats:4 }
       Output → rows: (1, 4, 8, 12)
   - Return both a plain text string and HTML markup so it can be rendered inline under instructions.

3. Integration:
   - Designed as a sub-block that can be attached to any shaping instruction block.
   - Can be called like:
       addSubBlock("rowMarkers", { start: 1, every: 4, repeats: 4 });
   - or used standalone with:
       renderRowMarkers(1, 4, 4);

4. Display:
   - Appears directly below the shaping instruction text.
   - Use <small> or a CSS class to make the text visually secondary.

5. Example usage:

Increase 1 stitch each side every 4 rows until you have 101 stitches
 <small>rows: (1, 4, 8, 12)</small>

6. CSS styling:

.pattern-instructions small {
 display: block;
 font-size: 0.9em;
 color: #555;
 margin-top: 0.2em;
 }
- Styling must be neutral and consistent with the existing `.pattern-builder` design.
- It should inherit typography from the parent container.

7. Code clarity:
- Comment logic steps clearly.
- Include error checking for invalid inputs (e.g., negative or zero values).
- Return an empty string if repeat data is missing or not applicable.

Goal:
Produce a reusable Row Marker Block module that can be attached to any shaping instructions.
