Replit Prompt — “Half-Stitch Shock” Gauge Comparison Wizard

Prompt for Replit:

Build a new Knit by Machine wizard called “Half-Stitch Shock” — an interactive tool that helps knitters visualize how small changes in gauge affect finished size.

The tool should use my existing lego-block components (GaugeInput, TableDisplay, UnitToggle, and ResultChart if available).

Purpose

Show knitters how even a small change (like ½ stitch per inch) can dramatically change project width. Reinforce the importance of knitting a proper swatch.

Structure

1. Hero Section

Use HeroMessage block.

Hero text:
A tiny change in gauge can make a big difference. See how your project grows (or shrinks) — one stitch at a time.

Subtext paragraph:
Even a half-stitch variation can add or subtract inches across a full garment. Enter two gauges below to see how your finished width changes.

2. Input Section

Use UnitToggle (Inches / CM).

Two labeled GaugeInput fields side-by-side:

Label 1: “Gauge 1 (stitches per 4 inches)”

Label 2: “Gauge 2 (stitches per 4 inches)”

Default example values: 20 and 21.

Add an info tooltip:
"Tip: If you change yarn or tension, even a ½ stitch difference can make your sweater an inch or two off!"

Add a “Compare” button that triggers the results table.

3. Results Section

On click, generate a comparison table like this:

Stitches Cast On	Width at Gauge 1	Width at Gauge 2	Total Difference
50	10.00	9.52	0.48
75	15.00	14.29	0.71
100	20.00	19.05	0.95
… etc (up to 200 in 25-st increments)			

Calculation formula:

Width = (Stitches / Gauge) * 4

Difference = |Width1 - Width2|

Use a loop to generate rows automatically up to 200 stitches.

Display enhancements:

Use soft color highlights (#52682D for Gauge 1, #6E8B3D for Gauge 2).

Animate table rows appearing when the user clicks “Compare.”

Show the Difference column in bold.

Optional: small horizontal bar chart or subtle progress indicator for width difference.

4. Reflection Section (below table)

Text block with this message:
Now imagine this difference across the full width of your sweater or blanket — even a half-stitch can change your project by several inches!

Add a CTA button:
“Plan a Proper Swatch” → link to /skill-builders/swatch (or placeholder for now).

5. Styling

Use Knit by Machine color palette:

Deep green: #52682D

Accent green: #6E8B3D

Soft neutral background: #F7F6F2

Rounded corners and subtle drop shadows for the chart table.

Fonts: Poppins for headings, Inter for body.

Use existing layout grid and spacing conventions from other KBM wizards.

6. Components & Behavior

Use GaugeInput, UnitToggle, and TableDisplay lego blocks.

Ensure responsive layout for mobile (inputs stacked, chart scrolls horizontally if needed).

When Compare is clicked:

Validate input (non-empty, positive numbers).

Smooth-scroll to results.

Auto-highlight the difference column.
