Create a modular JavaScript + HTML + CSS app called "Boat Neck Sweater Pattern Builder."

This app is part of a larger pattern system that assembles knitting patterns using reusable “lego blocks” for garment sections.

Use the new sleeve hook module that was just created to attach sleeve logic to this Boat Neck pattern.

Requirements:

1. Base garment structure:
   - Front and Back: two identical rectangular panels (no neckline shaping)
   - Sleeves: generated using the sleeve hook module
   - Optional finishing options (ribbing or hems)
   - All dimensions are calculated from user inputs

2. User input data (to come from localStorage or form object):

{
knittingFor: "women",
size: "M",
ease: { type: "standard", inches: 3 },
needles: 180,
gauge: { stitches: 5, rows: 7 },
units: "inches",
finishing: "ribbing"
}


3. Logic:
- Determine body width = base size width + ease
- Determine body length based on size chart JSON
- Determine sleeve length and width using the new sleeve hook
- If total stitches > available needles, display a note:
  “This size exceeds your needle bed. Panels are recommended.”
- Convert all measurements according to gauge and unit system

4. Output:
- Generate and display pattern instructions for:
  • Front panel
  • Back panel
  • Sleeves (from sleeve hook)
  • Finishing (ribbing or hem)
- Include a schematic-style text summary showing:
  Body Width, Body Length, Sleeve Length, and Needles Used
- Display yarn estimate if gauge and swatch data are available

5. Technical setup:
- Build this as a simple, self-contained web app
- No Bootstrap
- Use your `.pattern-builder` class for layout
- Include placeholder functions where the pattern engine will eventually plug in more advanced modules (neck shaping, A-line shaping, etc.)
- Comment the code clearly so the logic blocks can be reused for Drop Shoulder, Raglan, etc.

6. Visual:
- One-page layout
- Section for pattern summary
- Buttons: [Recalculate] [Download PDF] [Return to Builder]
- Light neutral styling for embedding inside Webflow

Goal:
Produce working pattern-generation code for a Boat Neck Sweater using the new sleeve hook, following the Knit by Machine modular pattern structure.
