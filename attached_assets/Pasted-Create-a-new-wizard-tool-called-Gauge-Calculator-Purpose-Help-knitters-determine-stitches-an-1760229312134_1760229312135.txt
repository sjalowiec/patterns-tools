Create a new wizard tool called “Gauge Calculator”.

Purpose:
Help knitters determine stitches and rows per 1" and per 4" (10 cm) from their knitted swatch.
This calculator improves accuracy by translating a measured swatch into precise gauge numbers.

Structure:
Use my existing LEGO layout and formatting system:
- instructions block
- input block (form fields)
- results block (two-column card)
- tip card block with a placeholder drawing area
- soft footer text

Styling:
- Use Tailwind only (no external CSS frameworks).
- Accent color: #52682d
- Light gray background (#f7f8f7)
- Rounded corners, soft shadows, clean spacing.
- Compact, mobile-friendly layout.
- Persist all input fields with localStorage keys.
- Keep design minimal — no header banner.

Inputs:
- Unit toggle: “Inches” or “Centimeters”
- Measured swatch width
- Measured swatch height
- Stitches counted
- Rows counted

Logic:
If unit = inches:
  stitches_per_in = stitches / width
  rows_per_in = rows / height
  stitches_per_4in = stitches_per_in * 4
  rows_per_4in = rows_per_in * 4

If unit = centimeters:
  stitches_per_10cm = (stitches / width) * 10
  rows_per_10cm = (rows / height) * 10
  stitches_per_in = stitches_per_10cm / 4
  rows_per_in = rows_per_10cm / 4

Round all results to two decimal places.

Display Rules:
- When unit = inches:
  Show stitches and rows per 1" and per 4".
- When unit = centimeters:
  Show stitches and rows per 10 cm (do not show “per cm”).
- Always display both stitch and row results side-by-side in a simple two-column layout.

Results Block:
Use a rounded results card with these elements:
- Column 1: Stitch gauge results
- Column 2: Row gauge results
- Include a small copy-to-clipboard button:
  Text format → “X sts / 4″ (10 cm), Y rows / 4″ (10 cm)”
- Add a small note below results:
  “Values are approximate. Always swatch carefully.”

Instructions Block:
Use the following text:

Title: “Ditch the Calculator!”
Body:
“The Gauge Calculator helps you determine the stitch and row gauge of your knitted swatch.
Accurate gauge measurements ensure your projects turn out as expected.”

Step-by-step:
1. Measure a 4″ (10 cm) area in the center of your swatch.
2. Count the stitches across and the rows vertically.
3. Enter your measurements and counts below.
4. View stitches and rows per 1″ and 4″ (10 cm).

Tip Card Block:
Title: “Tips for Accurate Measurements”
Bullets:
- Always measure your swatch after resting and blocking.
- Use a ruler with clear markings.
- Measure multiple sections of the swatch and average the results for better accuracy.
Include a placeholder labeled:
“(insert drawing of swatch measurement here)”

Footer:
Small, centered text:
“Built for machine knitters. Always swatch before you knit.”

Implementation:
- React functional component.
- Use Tailwind for all styling.
- Persist all input values using localStorage keys:
  gauge.unit, gauge.width, gauge.height, gauge.sts, gauge.rows
- Keep code modular, using reusable LEGO blocks for layout.
- Do not include a header or hero section — start directly with the instructions block.
