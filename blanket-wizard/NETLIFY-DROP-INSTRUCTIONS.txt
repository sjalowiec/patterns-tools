🎉 PUBLISH YOUR BLANKET WIZARD TO NETLIFY - EASY WAY! 🎉

This is the SIMPLEST way to publish - no GitHub, no complicated setup!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: Download Your Built Wizard from Replit
   • In Replit, find the "blanket-wizard" folder in your Files panel
   • Look INSIDE it for a folder called "dist"
   • RIGHT-CLICK on the "dist" folder
   • Click "Download"
   • Save the zip file to your computer
   • UNZIP it - you should now have a "dist" folder on your computer

STEP 2: Go to Netlify Drop
   • Open a new browser tab
   • Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
   • (You'll need to log in or create a free Netlify account if you haven't)

STEP 3: Drag and Drop!
   • Find the "dist" folder you downloaded (the UNZIPPED folder)
   • DRAG the entire "dist" folder onto the Netlify Drop page
   • (You should see a box that says "Drag and drop your site folder here")

STEP 4: Get Your Live URL!
   • Netlify will upload your files (takes 10-30 seconds)
   • You'll see a success message with a live URL
   • It will look like: random-name-12345.netlify.app
   • Click the URL - your wizard is LIVE! 🎉

STEP 5: (Optional) Get a Better URL
   • On the Netlify dashboard, click "Site settings"
   • Click "Change site name"
   • Type something like: blanket-pattern-wizard
   • Your URL becomes: blanket-pattern-wizard.netlify.app

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMPORTANT:
• Only download the "dist" folder (not the whole blanket-wizard folder)
• Make sure to UNZIP it before dragging to Netlify
• The drag-and-drop area wants the actual folder, not a zip file

THAT'S IT! No repositories, no build commands, no configuration! 🚀
