# Wizard Builder System

## Overview

The Wizard Builder is a comprehensive system for creating professional knitting pattern generator wizards. The system uses modular "lego block" architecture with reusable components, shared calculation logic, and a unified olive green theme. Currently includes the Neckline/Shoulder Practice Wizard, Blanket Pattern Wizard, Rectangle/Square Wizard, Neckline Shaping Wizard, Boat Neck Sweater Wizard, Gauge Calculator Wizard, and infrastructure to easily build additional wizards.

## Recent Changes

### October 12, 2025
- **Gauge Calculator Wizard**:
  - New wizard tool to help knitters convert swatch measurements into precise gauge numbers
  - Supports both inches and centimeters measurement systems
  - Calculates stitches and rows per 1" and per 4" (inches mode) or per 10cm (centimeters mode)
  - Shows per-inch conversion in both modes for universal compatibility
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality for formatted gauge text
  - localStorage persistence for all input values (gauge.unit, gauge.width, gauge.height, gauge.sts, gauge.rows)
  - Clean Tailwind-only design with #52682d accent color and #f7f8f7 background
  - Includes instructions, measurement tips, and placeholder for swatch drawing diagram
  - Proper unit conversion: per-10cm รท 3.937 = per-inch (10cm/2.54in)

### October 10, 2025
- **Machine Knitter Row-Based Instructions**:
  - Updated useSleeveDropShoulder to prioritize row counts over length measurements
  - Changed "work until measures X inches" to "work for Y rows total (sleeve will measure X inches at your gauge)"
  - Added total row count to final measurements: "16.5" (46 rows)"
  - Machine knitters now get exact row counts for all instructions

- **Sleeve Diagram Trapezoid Shaping**:
  - Enhanced PanelSchematic to support trapezoid shapes via optional `bottomWidth` prop
  - Sleeve diagrams now visually show shaping (narrow at cuff, wide at armhole)
  - Polygon coordinates correctly render narrower bottom (cast-on) and wider top (bind-off)
  - Body panels remain rectangular (no bottomWidth = rectangle rendering)

- **Development Navigation Redesign**:
  - Redesigned dev menu from horizontal to vertical stacked layout
  - Fixed position in top-left corner for easy access without fullscreen
  - Compact design using Tailwind classes (no inline styles)
  - CSS-based hover states (hover:bg-white/10) instead of event handlers
  - "Dev Menu" header with 6 wizard links vertically stacked

- **Boat Neck Wizard Pattern Instruction Improvements**:
  - Fixed neck marker format: Needles count from center zero, display as L# and R# (e.g., 50 sts = L25 and R25)
  - Added warning message "IMPORTANT: Your pattern will not be saved..." with no-print class
  - Removed row count from bind off instruction (now just "All stitches")
  - Updated shoulder seam instruction: "Join shoulder seams, leaving center open between the markers for the neck opening"
  - Simplified neckline finishing: "Finish neck opening as desired" for machine knitting
  - Exported WarningBox from lego components for consistency across wizards

### October 9, 2025
- **Boat Neck Wizard Improvements**:
  - Fixed size lookup bug in useSleeveDropShoulder hook - now handles both string and numeric size values from sizing data
  - Updated button styling to use Font Awesome icons ('fas fa-print', 'fas fa-download', 'fas fa-redo') with btn-round-wizard className
  - Repositioned StickyActionButtons to correct location (after PrintHeader, before content)
  - Added neck opening markers to body instructions using neck_opening from sizing data (Size 2 Misses: 6.5")
  - Implemented neck marker calculation: (neck_opening ร stitch_count) / 2, with bounds checking to prevent negative positions
  - Enhanced gauge validation to ensure stitchesPerUnit > 0 and rowsPerUnit > 0 before showing pattern
  - Sleeve diagram now renders correctly when sleeves option is selected

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables and design tokens
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state, TanStack Query for server state management

### Lego Block Architecture
The system provides reusable wizard components in `client/src/components/lego/`:
- **GaugeInputs**: Gauge measurement inputs with dynamic placeholders (per 4"/10cm)
- **PanelSchematic**: Universal knitting panel schematic component displaying bottom-to-top orientation (cast-on at bottom, armhole/cap at top) for all sweater pieces. Supports both rectangle (body panels) and trapezoid shapes (sleeves with shaping) via optional `bottomWidth` prop
- **RadioGroup**: Styled radio groups with olive green accent color
- **SchematicWrapper**: Centered SVG diagram wrapper with consistent padding and proper sizing
- **SizeSelector**: Card-based size selector with category grouping and selection states
- **RoundIconButton**: 56px mobile-friendly icon buttons with labels, supports both Font Awesome icons and emoji
- **WizardActionBar**: Flex layout with warning box + action buttons
- **StickyActionButtons**: Sticky action buttons (Print, Download PDF, Start Over) that float at top with transparent background while scrolling
- **WarningBox**: Reusable warning message box with olive green styling for important notices
- **PrintOnlyTitle**: Print/PDF-only title section (hidden on screen, visible in print output)
- **PrintHeader**: Print-only header using "Shadows Into Light Two" Google Font with KnitbyMachine branding (#649841 green) and URL (hidden on screen, visible in print/PDF)
- **PrintFooter**: Print-only footer with copyright, URL, generation date, and page numbers (hidden on screen, visible in print/PDF)
- **useGaugeCalculations**: Hook for unit-aware gauge calculations (4" vs 10cm)
- **useSleeveDropShoulder**: Hook for drop shoulder sleeve pattern generation with external sizing data, handles both string and numeric size values from sizing APIs, generates row-based instructions for machine knitters

All components use CSS variables for theming and are fully reusable across wizards.
